# admin

* We make portal for writer
* Writer login
* writter page is different
* they can preview what they have written like github markdown(.md file)
* there must be some
* we will try to implement some thing that the writter will get the exact percent of what they have written and how much engagement they got,and they will get paid accourding to their egnagement(this will be complex we will discuss later if this proceess is good/ fesible or not)
* But to implement editor page  or writter admin portal we have to add text editor features(ex bold,hyperlink,typeing,moiving back and front, heading, text size, We will customize according to our needs)
* Topic wise content
* we will not enable bot to extract text from our website except google crawler as i think it always do

# contents on our Website

* Add Questions to intract after every section, so that user shoul spend more time on our site. (we should also focus on user retention and engage time on our website)
* Add direct Answer to the search term- > This leads to better search result ans help to get more reach
* Add key take way points
